  Many HPC applications rely on Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS)
  parallel programming models as a means to efficiently manage shared
  data located across multiple nodes in a distributed memory system.
  These models are typically directly addressed which may render them
  difficult to use with loosely-structured or sparse data. Locating 
  a given data element with a PGAS can be a complex process with 
  substantial overhead. Additional overhead may be incurred by performing
  lookups from remote location resolution structures. Additionally,
  large data structures may consume memory and create coherence
  problems that may limit scalability.

  We propose that the matching systems used by implementations of the Message
  Passing Interface (MPI) can be used to create a separation between 
  write operations and the physical location that data is stored. This work
  explores the extension of such structures to establish an indirection
  layer between incoming read operations and the physical location of the
  requested object, thereby effectively extending PGAS models with support
  for logical addressing.
