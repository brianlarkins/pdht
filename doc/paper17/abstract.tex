Many HPC applications have successfully applied Partitioned Global Address
Space (PGAS) parallel programming models to efficiently manage shared data
that is distributed across multiple nodes in a distributed memory system.
However, while the flat addressing model provided by PGAS systems is
effective for regular array data, it renders such systems difficult to use
with loosely-structured or sparse data.  This work proposes a logically
addressed PGLAS model that naturally supports a variety of data models
through the automatic mapping of an application-defined key space onto the
underlying distributed memory system.  We present an efficient
implementation of the PGLAS model in the form of a parallel distributed
hash table (PDHT) and demonstrate that this model is amenable to offloading
using the Portals 4 network programming interface.  We demonstrate the
effectiveness of PDHT using representative applications from the
computational chemistry and genomics domains.  Results indicate that PGLAS
models such as PDHT provide a promising new method for parallelizing
applications with non-regular data.
