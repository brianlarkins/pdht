\begin{abstract}

Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) parallel programming models can provide
an efficient mechanism for managing shared data stored across multiple nodes in a
distributed memory system.  However, these models are traditionally directly
addressed and, for applications with loosely-structured or sparse data,
determining the location of a given data element within a PGAS can incur
significant overheads.  When location resolution structures are remote,
applications incur overhead from the network latency of remote lookups.
Further, for large data, caching such structures locally incurs space and
coherence overheads that can limit scaling.
%
We observe that the matching structures used by implementations of the Message
Passing Interface (MPI) establish a separation between incoming data writes and
the location where data will be stored.  In this work, we investigate extending
such structures to add a layer of indirection between incoming data reads
and the location from which data will be read, effectively extending PGAS models
with logical addressing.
