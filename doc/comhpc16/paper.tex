\begin{abstract}
This is an abstract abstract. This is totally a placeholder that is
just designed to take up approximately the correct amount of space on
the page. This will totally need to be re-written before we really get
anywhere with it. I just checked and it's only at about 50 words right
now. I need to come up with about another fifty words or so until I
can get back to writing the introduction. 86. That's not quite
100. We can put another fourteen words to paper, at which point it
will be deemed ``sufficiently long''.  This should just about do it.
