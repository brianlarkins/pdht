Welcome to the BeBOP Utility Library!  This is a collection of C routines and
macros that I wrote over the course of several years for my colleagues in the 
Berkeley Benchmarking and Optimization Group (bebop.cs.berkeley.edu).  


1. Building the library

Tweak the Makefile as necessary to suit your local settings.  Then,
at the prompt, type:

make

to build libbebop_util.a (the library).


2. Installing the library

Currently, it's the user's responsibility to put libbebop_util.a and the header
files in a place where other projects can find them.  You will have to modify
the Makefiles of those projects to point to libbebop_util.a and the directory
containing the header files.  Eventually we will set up a proper installation
procedure using the GNU Autotools.


3. Documentation

You can build the documentation in HTML format using Doxygen.  Type the
following at the prompt:

doxygen Doxyfile

You will need to have Doxygen installed.
