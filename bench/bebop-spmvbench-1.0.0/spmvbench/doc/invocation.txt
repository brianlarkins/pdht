The SpMV benchmark was intended for use as a library, to be called by
the HPC Challenge suite of benchmarks.  However, a standalone executable
wrapper is made available for the convenience of users.  By default, the 
Makefile builds only the library; the following builds the standalone
executable as well:

make arch=<ARCH> hpcc_interface_tester

Replace <ARCH> with the name of your platform, by which we mean the
name of the makefile that describes your platform's specialized build
parameters:  e.g. if the makefile is named Make.citris, <ARCH> is
citris.

The above command will build an executable called
"hpcc_interface_tester".  Running the file with the -h command-line
option will describe all of its command-line options.
