 * @ingroup MD
 * @note Performance conscious users should not mix offsets (local or remote)
 *      with ptl_iovec_t. While this is a supported operation, it is unlikely
 *      to perform well in most implementations.
 * @note When a ptl_iovec_t is passed to a Portals operation (as part of a
 *      memory descriptor, list entry, or match list entry), it must be treated
 *      exactly like a data buffer. That is, it cannot be modified or freed
 *      until Portals indicates that it has completed the operations on that
 *      buffer.
 * @implnote The implementation is required to support the mixing of the
 *      ptl_iovec_t type with offsets (local and remote); however, it will be
 *      difficult to make this perform well in the general case. The correct
 *      behavior in this scenario is to treat the region described by the
 *      ptl_iovec_t type as if it were a single contiguous region. In some
 *      cases, this may require walking the entire scatter/gather list to find
 *      the correct location for depositing the data.
 * @implnote The implementation may choose to copy the ptl_iovec_t to prevent
 *      the application from corrupting it; however, the implementation is also
 *      free to use the buffer in place. The implementation is not allowed to

 * @brief Used to search for a message in the unexpected list associated with a
 *      specific portal table entry specified by \a pt_index for the portal
 *      table for \a ni_handle. PtlLESearch() uses the exact same search of the
 *      unexpected list as PtlLEAppend(); however, the list entry specified in
 *      the PtlLESearch() call is never linked into a priority list.
 *
 *      The PtlLESearch() function can be called in two modes. If \a ptl_search_op
 *      is set to PTL_SEARCH_ONLY, the unexpected list is searched to support
 *      the MPI_Probe functionality. If \a ptl_search_op is set to
 *      PTL_SEARCH_DELETE, the unexpected list is searched and any matching
 *      items are deleted. A search of the unexpected list will \e always
 *      generate a detailed event. When used with PTL_SEARCH_ONLY, a
 *      PTL_EVENT_SEARCH detailed event is always generated. If a matching
 *      message was found in the unexpected list, PTL_NI_OK is returned in the
 *      detailed event. Otherwise, the detailed event indicates that the search
 *      operation failed. When used with PTL_SEARCH_DELETE, the event that is
 *      generated corresponds to the type of operation that is found (e.g.
 *      PTL_EVENT_PUT_OVERFLOW or PTL_EVENT_ATOMIC_OVERFLOW). If no operation
 *      is found, a PTL_EVENT_SEARCH is generated with a failure indication of
 *      \c PTL_NI_NO_MATCH. If the list entry specified in the PtlLESearch()
 *      call is persistent, an event is generated for every match in the
 *      unexpected list.
 *
 *      Event generation for the search function works just as it would for an
 *      append function. If a search is performed with detailed events disabled
 *      (either through option or through the absence of an event queue on the
 *      portal table entry), the search will succeed, but no detailed events
 *      will be generated. Status registers, however, are handled slightly
 *      differently for a search in that a PtlLESearch()never causes a status
 *      register to be incremented.
 * @note Searches with persistent entries could have unexpected performance and
 *      resource usage characteristics if a large unexpected list has
 *      accumulated, since a PtlLESearch() that uses a persistent LE can cause
 *      multiple matches.
 * @param[in] ni_handle     The interface handle to use
 * @param[in] pt_index      The portal table index to search.
 * @param[in] le            Provides values for the user-visible parts of a
 *                          list entry to use for searching.
 * @param[in] ptl_search_op Determines whether the function will delete any
 *                          list entries that match the search parameters.
 * @param[in] user_ptr      A user-specified value that is associated with each
 *                          command that can generate an event. The value does
 *                          not need to be a pointer, but must fit in the space
 *                          used by a pointer. This value (along with other
 *                          values) is recorded in events associated with
 *                          operations on this list entry.
 * @retval PTL_OK           Indicates success.
 * @retval PTL_ARG_INVALID  Indicates that an invalid argument was passed. THe
 *                          definition of which arguments are checked is

 * @brief The PtlMESearch() function is used to search for a message in the
 *      unexpected list associated with a specific portal table entry specified
 *      by pt_index for the portal table for ni_handle. PtlMESearch() uses the
 *      exact same search of the unexpected list as PtlMEAppend(); however, the
 *      match list entry specified in the PtlMESearch() call is never linked
 *      into a priority list.
 *
 *      The PtlMESearch() function can be called in two modes. If ptl_search_op
 *      is set to PTL_SEARCH_ONLY, the unexpected list is searched to support
 *      the MPI_Probe functionality. If ptl_search_op is set to
 *      PTL_SEARCH_DELETE, the unexpected list is searched and any matching
 *      items are deleted. A search of the unexpected list will always generate
 *      an event. When used with PTL_SEARCH_ONLY, a PTL_EVENT_SEARCH event is
 *      always generated. If a matching message was found in the unexpected list,
 *      PTL_NI_OK is returned in the event. Otherwise, the event indicates that
 *      the search operation failed. When used with PTL_SEARCH_DELETE, the
 *      event that is generated corresponds to the type of operation that is
 *      found (e.g. PTL_EVENT_PUT_OVERFLOW or PTL_EVENT_ATOMIC_OVERFLOW). If no
 *      operation is found, a PTL_EVENT_SEARCH is generated with a failure
 *      indication.
 *
 *      Event generation for the search functions works just as it would for an
 *      append function. If a search is performed with events disabled (either
 *      through option or through the absence of an event queue on the portal
 *      table entry), the search will succeed, but no events will be generated.
 *      Status registers, however, are handled slightly differently for a
 *      search in that a PtlMESearch() never causes a status register to be
 *      incremented.
 * @see PtlLESearch()
 * @param[in] ni_handle     The interface handle to use

 * @param[in] ptl_search_op Determines whether the function will delete any
 *                          match list entries that match the search parameters.

 *                          used by a pointer. This value (along with other
 *                          values) is recorded in events associated with

 *      process). The value \c PTL_ACK_REQ requests an acknowledgment, the
 *      value \c PTL_NO_ACK_REQ requests that no acknowledgment should be
 *      generated, the value \c PTL_CT_ACK_REQ requests a simple counting
 *      acknowledgment, and the value \c PTL_OC_ACK_REQ requests an operation
 *      completed acknowledgment. When a counting acknowledgment is requested,
 *      the operations in the requesting memory descriptor can be set to count
 *      either events or bytes. If the \c PTL_MD_EVENT_CT_BYTES option is set
 *      and the operation is successful, the requested length (\a rlength) is
 *      counted for a \c PTL_EVENT_SEND event and the modified length (\a
 *      mlength) from the target is counted. If the event would indicate
 *      "failure" or the \c PTL_MD_EVENT_CT_BYTES option is not set, the number
 *      of acknowledgments is counted. The operation completed acknowledgment
 *      is an acknowledgment that simply indicates that the operation has
 *      completed at the target. It \e does \e not indicate what was done with
 *      the message. The message may have been dropped due to a permission
 *      violation or may not have matched in the priority list or overflow
 *      list; however, the operation completed acknowledgment would still be
 *      sent. The operation completed acknowledgment is a subset of the
 *      counting acknowledgment with weaker semantics. That is, it is a
 *      counting type of acknowledgment, but it can only count operations.

/************************
* Atomic Operations *
************************/
/*!
 * @addtogroup atomic Atomic Operations
 * @{
 * Portals defines three closely related types of atomic operations. The
 * PtlAtomic() function is a one-way operation that performs an atomic
 * operation on data at the \e target with the data passed in the \p put memory
 * descriptor. The PtlFetchAtomic() function extends PtlAtomic() to be an
 * atomic fetch-and-update operation; thus, the value at the \e target before
 * the operation is returned in a \p reply message and placed into the \p get
 * memory descriptor of the \e initiator. Finally, the PtlSwap() operation
 * atomically swaps data (including compare-and-swap and swap-under-mask, which
 * require an \a operand argument).
 *
 * The length of the operations performed by a PtlAtomic() are restricted to no
 * more than \a max_atomic_size bytes. PtlFetchAtomic() and PtlSwap() operations
 * can be up to \a max_fetch_atomic_size bytes, except for \c PTL_CSWAP and \c
 * PTL_MSWAP operations and their variants, which are further restricted to the
 * length of the longest native data type in all implementations.
 *
 * While the length of an atomic operation is potentially multiple data items,
 * the granularity of the atomic access is limited to the basic datatype. That
 * is, atomic operations from different sources may be interleaved at the level
 * of the datatype being accessed. Furthermore, atomic operations are only
 * atomic with respect to other calls to the Portals API on the same network
 * interface (\a ni_handle). In addition, an implementation is only required to
 * support Portals atomic operations that are natively aligned to the size of
 * the datatype, but it may choose to provide support for unaligned accesses.
 * Atomicity is only guaranteed for two atomic operations using the same
 * datatype, and overlapping atomic operations that use different datatypes are
 * not atomic with respect to each other. The routine PtlAtomicSync() is
 * provided to enable the host (or atomic operations using other datatypes) to
 * modify memory locations that have been previously touched by an atomic
 * operation.
 *
 * The \e target match list entry must be configured to respond to \p put
 * operations and to \p get operations if a reply is desired. The \a length
 * argument at the initiator is used to specify the size of the request.
 *
 * There are several events that can be associated with atomic operations. When
 * data is sent from the \e initiator node, a \c PTL_EVENT_SEND event is
 * registered on the \e initiator node. If data is sent from the \e target
 * node, a \c PTL_EVENT_ATOMIC event is registered on the \e target node; and
 * if data is returned from the \e target node, a \c PTL_EVENT_REPLY event is
 * registered on the \e initiator node. Similarly, a \c PTL_EVENT_ACK can be
 * registered on the \e initiator node in the event queue specified by the \a
 * put_md_handle for the atomic operations that do not return data. Note that
 * the target match list entry must have the \c PTL_ME_OP_PUT flag set and must
 * also set the \c PTL_ME_OP_GET flag to enable a reply.
 *
 * The three atomic functions share two new arguments introduced in Portals
 * 4.0: an operation (ptl_op_t) and a datatype (ptl_datatype_t). All three
 * atomic functions are required to be natively aligned at the target to the
 * size of the ptl_datatype_t used.
 *
 * @implnote To allow upper level libraries with both system-defined datatype
 *      widths and fixed width datatypes to easily map to Portals, Portals
 *      provides fixed width integer types. The one exception is the long
 *      double floating point types (PTL_LONG_DOUBLE). Because of the
 *      variability in long double encodings across systems and the lack of
 *      standard syntax for fixed width floating-point types, Portals uses a
 *      system defined width for PTL_LONG_DOUBLE and PTL_LONG_DOUBLE_COMPLEX.

/************************
* Triggered Operations *
************************/
/*!
 * @addtogroup TO Triggered Operations
 * @{
 * For a variety of scenarios, it is desirable to setup a response to incoming
 * messages. As an example, a tree based reduction operation could be performed
 * by having each layer of the tree issue a PtlAtomic() operation to its parent
 * after receiving a PtlAtomic() from all of its children. To provide this
 * operation, triggered versions of each of the data movement operations are
 * provided. To create a triggered operation, a \a trig_ct_handle and an
 * integer \a threshold are added to the argument list. When the count (the sum
 * of the success and failure fields) referenced by the \a trig_ct_handle
 * argument reaches or exceeds the \a threshold (equal to or greater), the
 * operation proceeds \e at \e the \e initiator \e of \e the \e operation. For
 * example, a PtlTriggeredGet() or a PtlTriggeredAtomic() will not leave the \e
 * initiator until the threshold is reached. A triggered operation does not use
 * the state of the buffer when the application calls the Portals function.
 * Instead, it uses the state of the buffer after the threshold condition is
 * met. Pending triggered operations can be canceled using
 * PtlCTCancelTriggered().
 *
 * @note The use of a \a trig_ct_handle and \a threshold enables a variety of
 *      usage models. A single match list entry can trigger one operation (or
 *      several) by using an independent \a trig_ct_handle on the match list
 *      entry. One operation can be triggered by a combination of previous
 *      events (include a combination of initiator and target side events) by
 *      having all of the earlier operations reference a single \a
 *      trig_ct_handle and using an appropriate threshold.
 * @implnote The semantics of triggered operations imply that (at a minimum)
 *      operations will proceed in the order that their trigger threshold is
 *      reached. A quality implementation will also release operations that
 *      reach their threshold simultaneously on the same \a trig_ct_handle in
 *      the order that they are issued.
 *
 * @implnote The most straightforward way to implement triggered operations is
 *      to associate a list of dependent operations with the structure
 *      referenced by a \a trig_ct_handle. Operations depending on the same \a
 *      trig_ct_handle with the same \a threshold \e should proceed in the
 *      order that they were issued; thus, the list of operations associated
 *      with a \a trig_ct_handle may be sorted for faster searching.
 *
 * @implnote The triggered operation is released when the counter referenced by
 *      the \a trig_ct_handle reaches or exceeds the \a threshold. This means
 *      that the triggered operation must check the value of the \a
 *      trig_ct_handle in an atomic way when it is first associated with the \a
 *      trig_ct_handle.

/*!
 * @addtogroup DCO Deferred Communication Operations
 * @{
 * In many cases, the application has knowledge of its intended usage model
 * that could be used to improve the performance of the implementation if there
 * was a way to convey that knowledge. When an application informs the
 * implementation of an intended usage model, it is binding on the application:
 * the application cannot violate the usage model conveyed to the
 * implementation. In contrast, such information is only a hint to the
 * implementation: the implementation is not required to change its behavior
 * based on the usage model the application describes. One prevalent usage
 * model that many implementations could optimize for is a stream of operations
 * in close temporal proximity. Informing the implementation of an impending
 * stream of operations may allow it to optimize the conveyance of those
 * operations through the messaging system (e.g. across the host bus or even
 * across the network).
 *
 * @fn PtlStartBundle(ptl_handle_ni_t ni_handle)
 * @brief Indicates a group of communication operations is about to start.
 * @details The PtlStartBundle() function is used by the application to
 *      indicate to the implementation that a group of communication operations
 *      is about to start. PtlStartBundle() takes an \a ni_handle as an
 *      argument and only impacts operations on that \a ni_handle.
 *      PtlStartBundle() can be called multiple times, and each call to
 *      PtlStartBundle() increments a reference count and must be matched by a
 *      call to PtlEndBundle(). After a call to PtlStartBundle(), the
 *      implementation may begin deferring communication operations until a
 *      call to PtlEndBundle().
 * @param[in] ni_handle     An interface handle to start bundling operations.
 * @retval PTL_OK           Indicates success.
 * @retval PTL_NO_INIT      Indicates that the portals API has not been
 *                          successfully initialized.
 * @retval PTL_ARG_INVALID  Indicates that an invalid argument was passed. The
 *                          definition of which arguments are checked is
 *                          implementation dependent.
 * @note Layered libraries and heavily nested PtlStartBundle() calls can yield
 *      unexpected results. The PtlStartBundle() and PtlEndBundle() interface
 *      was designed for use in short periods of high activity (e.g. during the
 *      setup of a collective operation or duing an inner loop for PGAS
 *      languages). The interval between PtlStartBundle() and the corresponding
 *      PtlEndBundle() should be kept short.
 * @implnote The PtlStartBundle() and PtlEndBundle() interface was designed to
 *      allow the implementation to avoid unnecessary sfence()/memory barrier
 *      operations during periods that the application expects high message
 *      rate usage. A quality implementation will attempt to minimize latency
 *      while maximizing message rate. For example, an implementation that
 *      requires writes into “write-combining” space may require sfence()
 *      operations with every message to have relatively deterministic latency.
 *      Between a PtlStartBundle() and PtlEndBundle(), the implementation might
 *      simply omit the sfence() operations.
